        <p>Come and play games with us on PC, Xbox One, PS4, Wii U and others. Or take a seat at our gaming tables and try out some of our board games or bring your own games or decks. Our cost is only <span class="text-highlights text-highlights-blue rounded-2x">$4 per hour, $10 for 3 hours or $20 for all day</span>.</p>
        <h3>Local Servers</h3>
        <p>Play on our local servers in Minecraft, Starbound and others. We keep player stats and host whatever games are requested and possible to host. Seriously, if you want something to be hosted so you can play multiplayer, ask us and we'll probably install it that day.</p>
        <h3>Tournaments</h3>
        <p>We run tournaments in all types of games, from FPS and fighting games to card and dice games. Our schedule will be posted up here once we have it started but we are planning on hosting tournaments for the following games (but we're always willing to hear requests and try to facilitate any game you want).</p>
