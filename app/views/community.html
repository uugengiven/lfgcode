    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>We are a group of people who work and play well with others. During the day, we build websites, support network infrastructures, design plastics, teach and more. We want everyone to feel welcome at LFG and build our community on a foundation of friendliness, trust and collaboration. </p>
    
    <h1>Events</h1>
    <p>Each month we run community building events, from Code and Supply meetups to console building classes. We want everyone who comes through the doors to enjoy themselves, feel at home and learn something new.</p>
    
    <h1>Party Nights</h1>
    <p>Once (or twice, if people really like it) a month we will be having over 21 nights, inviting a brewery to provide beer for tasting and having a one price, all night gaming and social party at LFG.</p>
